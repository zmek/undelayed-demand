    "# Visualise un-delayed demand for beds for admitted patients\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason why Emergency Departments (EDs) fail to meet admissions targets is because beds are not available at the time patients arrive. Most discharges happen in the afternoon, so patients arriving at night into a full hospital often have to wait until late the following day to be admitted. UCLH wanted to understand their un-delayed demand over the course of a day - that is, when beds would be needed if patients were processed within the 4-hour target time. A formal term for this (used in queueing theory) is \"offered load\". Here we use \"un-delayed demand\" as it better conveys the concept to healthcare staff. UCLH wanted to understand their undelayed demand patterns to inform an improvement project focus on their emergency patient pathway.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook generates charts that aim to answer the following questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the typical pattern of arrivals of admitted patients over the day?\n",
    "* If ED was meeting 4-hour targets for admitted patients, when would beds for these patients need to be ready?**\n",
    "* Are there differences in the above between weekends and weekdays? \n",
    "* The discharge window, when decision-makers are on wards, is between 8.30 am and 5 pm. If a hospital wants to meet its ED targets on a consistent basis, then there should be enough empty beds to cover demand over night by the end of the discharge window when decision-makers leave. How many beds would need to be available at the end of discharge window to cover all demand over night? \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions we will prepare a model using only \n",
    "\n",
    "* historical arrival rates of patients later admitted\n",
    "* 4-hour targets for ED. We assume that the hospital might want to choose a certain percentage of admitted patients to be processed into a bed within 4 hours, accordingly to current targets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we refer to both Emergency Department (EDs) and Same Day Emergency Care (SDECs) since patients can be admitted to the hospital from both. \n",

    "The charts above have used in presentations with UCLH's patient flow improvement group, as part of a wider project on Emergency Patient Pathways. They help to focus attention on a very intractable problem. Hospitals are full, most of the time. Beds are vacated at certain times of day, typically afternoons and early evening. People show up at the ED/SDEC all through the day, not just at times that suit the way the hospital works. This makes it very difficult to hit ED targets when hospitals are full, unless proactive steps are taken. \n",
